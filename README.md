# facial-expression-recognition

In this project I was trying to train a model to perform facial expression recogntion. 
This is based on the fer2013 dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicolejyt/facialexpressionrecognition].

I experimented with a pretty standard CNN architecture and with a VGG-type model(basically as in [https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/]).

The purpose here was to get familiar with the workflow in pytorch rather than to train a competetive model. 
In particular, I have not invested a lot into tweaking the model. 
Considering that the benchmark for this problem is at 70-80% accuracy, the accuracy of the second model at aroung 60% is decent.
